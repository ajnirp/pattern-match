## PatternMatch
PatternMatch is a puzzle based game that challenges the user to create a set of parent patterns that acts as a template to for a larger set of child patterns shown to them. The user is allowed to modify the 5 parent templates that are presented, by copying sequences of shapes from the child set. Each child pattern is scored by the number of different parent patterns that are used to recreate it, and the objective of the game is to minimize the cumulative score by changing the parent patterns to match the children as far as possible.
